# Object oriented programming continued 
## 4 pillars of OOP 

## Encapsulation 
- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside
- Achieved using private attributes and providing public methods to access and update them 
- Syntax: __varname 

## Abstraction 
- Concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object 
- Achieved by using Abstract class and method 

## Abstraction class and method 
- Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and usually contains one or more abstract methods 
- Abstract method is a method that is declared but contains no implementation 
- Python 'abc' module is required to create these classes and methods 

## Inheritance 
- Mechanism of creating a new class based on an existing class, by inheriting properities (attributes and/or methods)
- Parent class: The class from where the features are inherited from 
- Child class: The class that inherits the features 
- Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintenance 

## Polymorphism 
- Ability to present the same interface for different data types 
- Allows methods to do different things based on the object is acting upon
